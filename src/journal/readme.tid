! Journal

My personal journal structure and styles for TiddlyWiki. Log daily activities, thoughts, and reflections in a structured format that roll up into summary views for reflection.

This plugin provides templates, macros, and styles to create daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly journal entries with sections for habits, wins, challenges, and gratitude.

Requires [[dayjs Plugin|https://github.com/mblackman/tiddlywiki-dayjs-plugin]] to function.

Optional [[Media Importer Plugin|https://github.com/mblackman/tiddlywiki-media-importer]] integration for logging media consumption.
